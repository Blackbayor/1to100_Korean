"""
Fine-tunes the LayoutLMv3 model for document layout analysis.

This script is designed to be run as a SageMaker Training Job, but can also be
run locally for debugging purposes.

It will perform the following steps:
1.  Load the pre-processed dataset created by `prepare_dataset.py`.
2.  Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
3.  Initialize the LayoutLMv3 model, processor, and tokenizer from Hugging Face.
4.  Define the training arguments (`TrainingArguments`) and evaluation metrics.
5.  Set up the `Trainer` instance.
6.  Run the training and evaluation loop.
7.  Save the fine-tuned model artifacts to the specified output directory
    (which will be `/opt/ml/model` in a SageMaker environment).
